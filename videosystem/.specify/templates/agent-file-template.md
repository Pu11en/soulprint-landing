# ViraCut MVP Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

## Core Principles

1. **Radical Minimalism** - Build minimal, fast, extensible video commercial creation platform with zero bloat
2. **Performance-First Development** - Mobile-first performance with < 3s TTI on 3G, 60fps canvas, < 100ms touch response
3. **Atomic Design System** - Component architecture using atomic design patterns with reusable elements
4. **Strict Architecture Layers** - Clear separation between canvas state, node configuration, and project state
5. **Data Integrity Guarantees** - Auto-save functionality, validation patterns, and error handling

## Performance Requirements

- Time to Interactive < 3 seconds on 3G networks
- Canvas rendering maintains 60fps on target devices
- Touch response time < 100ms for all interactive elements
- Auto-save completes within 500ms without UI interruption
- Component load time < 100ms for atomic elements

## Architecture Guidelines

- Canvas state management must be isolated
- Node configuration separated from project state
- Components follow atomic design hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Data integrity validation at all boundaries
- Error handling prevents data loss scenarios
