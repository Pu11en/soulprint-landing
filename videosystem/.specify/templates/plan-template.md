# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### ViraCut MVP Constitution Compliance

**Core Principles to Validate:**

1. **Radical Minimalism** - Is this feature essential for a minimal video commercial creation platform?
   - [ ] Zero bloat - no unnecessary features
   - [ ] Fast and extensible architecture
   - [ ] Essential functionality only

2. **Performance-First Development** - Does this meet mobile-first performance targets?
   - [ ] < 3 seconds TTI on 3G networks
   - [ ] 60fps canvas rendering
   - [ ] < 100ms touch response time
   - [ ] Mobile-optimized implementation

3. **Atomic Design System** - Does this follow atomic design patterns?
   - [ ] Component-based architecture
   - [ ] Reusable, composable elements
   - [ ] Clear hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms)

4. **Strict Architecture Layers** - Does this maintain clear separation?
   - [ ] Canvas state management isolated
   - [ ] Node configuration separated from project state
   - [ ] Clear data flow boundaries

5. **Data Integrity Guarantees** - Does this ensure data safety?
   - [ ] Auto-save functionality implemented
   - [ ] Validation patterns in place
   - [ ] Error handling prevents data loss
   - [ ] Recovery mechanisms defined

**Compliance Status**: [PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL]
**Violations**: [List any constitutional violations with justification]
**Mitigations**: [How violations will be addressed]

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
